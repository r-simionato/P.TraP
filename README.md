PlumeTraP is a MATLAB-based code that semi-automatically tracks volcanic
plumes from visible-wavelenghts videos and is also capable of automatically
calculating the geometric parameters of the plume.

Detection and parameterization of volcanic plumes in visible videos.
Starting from a video, frames are saved, segmented through a specific
technique and basilar parameters of the plume through time are extracted.

Tested up to MATLAB R2023b and Image Processing Toolbox 23.2

Two versions of PlumeTraP are available:
- APP version (PlumeTraP.mlapp)
- script version (PlumeTraP_script.m)

## Documentation
The general workflow of PlumeTraP is presented in the user's manual 
(https://github.com/r-simionato/PlumeTraP). 
For further information see "Simionato R., Jarvis P.A., Rossi E.,
Bonadonna C., 2022 - PlumeTraP: a new MATLAB-based algorithm to detect and
parametrize volcanic plumes from visible-wavelength images" or contact the 
authors. For specific functioning or setting up the user may refer to the 
MATLAB scripts, which are appropriately documented.
